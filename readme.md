## Welcome to GPT Home!
This project was created by RobbyV2 on GitHub as a home project to replace Alexa.


### Getting Started

In order to install the requirements, type ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the same directory as the project.
Then you may open up a console or ide to run the program. You may do this in a console by typing ```python main.py```


## Info
GPT Home stores your config in the **config.json** file, currently the name does not do anything. However, "getid" causes the console to print out all audio devices, mainly so you can figure out which id to use as your microphone input.

I also put my microphone ID (51) used from getid in the config.json file, so you will need to change that in config.json to the ID of the audio input device you want to use.

Keep in mind I do not provide an api key as this may cost money, if you want to use this you will need to go to [OpenAI's Offical Website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

If you don't already have python, you may install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This should work with all python versions, but I'm currently using it on python 3.9.

I'm planning to host this on a raspberry pi 3, with a 3d printed case. The microphone and speakers are separate adapters. If you're planning to use this on your own raspberry pi, I recommend either installing a light weight os or keeping the default os the raspberry pi comes with.
### Contributing
As I am very new to this, feel free to literally add anything you want since it would be a huge help. Just make sure to follow basic guidelines!
